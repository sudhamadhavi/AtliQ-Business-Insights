# AtliQ-Business-Insights

  
  
## About Atliq:
AtliQ Hardware, a major computer and accessories company, sells globally through retailers and direct distributors. They grew a lot in recent years and tried to expand into Latin America by opening their own store, but it resulted in a huge loss. This happened because they made decisions based on surveys and basic Excel analysis. This showed the need for a dedicated analytics team to guide the company with data-driven insights and decisions.

## Project Objective:
During the annual strategic meeting, the decision was made to onboard data analytics capabilities and implement Power BI for comprehensive analysis across different parts of AtliQ Hardware's business, such as Finance, Sales, Supply Chain, Executive Management, and Marketing
